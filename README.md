# FormStyler

Super simple module to change the defaults for rendered forms in processwire. Useful in modules that require hooking to style. This just goes a little bit further and lets you add in your own classes from your css. 

*Curently only allows for selection of all fields of one type, so if you are looking for more control you will still have to go in and edit your forms.
